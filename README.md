# Visualization System for Deep Learning Model Performance

This repository contains a set of visualization tools developed in Jupyter Notebooks to support the analysis and interpretation of deep learning model performance. The system includes three main notebooks: `visualization_system_A.ipynb`, `visualization_system_B.ipynb`, and `visualization_system_C.ipynb`. Each notebook serves a unique purpose in the data exploration, evaluation, and result presentation processes.

## Project Overview

The visualization system is designed to provide in-depth insights into the behavior and performance of deep learning models. These notebooks include visualizations for key metrics such as accuracy, loss, data distributions, and feature importance. They are highly customizable, allowing users to adapt them to specific datasets and models.

### Notebooks Overview

1. **visualization_system_A.ipynb**:  
   Focuses on visualizing data distributions, feature correlations, and key descriptive statistics to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset before training.

2. **visualization_system_B.ipynb**:  
   Offers tools to track and visualize the model’s training and validation performance across epochs. This includes accuracy and loss curves, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices.

3. **visualization_system_C.ipynb**:  
   Provides post-training insights, such as model predictions versus ground truth, and advanced metrics like F1-score, AUC, and feature importance. It also includes visualizations for misclassified samples to better understand model limitations.

## Installation

To set up and use the visualization system, please follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have all necessary packages installed by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start the Jupyter Notebook environment in your project directory:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Notebooks

1. **Data Exploration (visualization_system_A.ipynb)**:  
   Open `visualization_system_A.ipynb` to explore the dataset and visualize data distributions. This notebook is useful for performing initial data analysis, detecting class imbalances, and identifying correlations between features.

2. **Training Performance Visualization (visualization_system_B.ipynb)**:  
   Use `visualization_system_B.ipynb` to visualize the training and validation performance of your model. This notebook includes tools for plotting accuracy, loss over epochs, confusion matrices, and precision-recall curves, providing insights into model convergence and generalization.

3. **Post-Training Analysis (visualization_system_C.ipynb)**:  
   Run `visualization_system_C.ipynb` to analyze model predictions and evaluate advanced metrics. This notebook is particularly useful for examining misclassified samples, visualizing feature importance, and calculating performance metrics like F1-score and AUC.

### Customization

Each notebook is designed to be flexible and adaptable. You can modify the parameters, dataset paths, and model configurations within each notebook to fit your specific needs.
